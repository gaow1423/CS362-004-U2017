Bug-Reports:Bug1: For Smithy card implementation, the smithy is not discarded after implemented.     Result:     According to  unittest, this is the detail result as follows:     TEST#1: +3 cardsPlayer 0Test_state hand count =Ê Ê 8, Base_state hand count =Ê Ê 5Test_state deck count =Ê Ê 2, Base_state deck count =Ê Ê 5Test_state discard count = 0, Base_state discard count = 0ERROR: Hand counts didn't increase properlyERROR: discard counts don't matchPlayer 1Test_state hand count =Ê Ê 0, Base_state hand count =Ê Ê 0Test_state deck count =Ê Ê 10, Base_state deck count =Ê Ê 10Test_state discard count = 0, Base_state discard count = 0Player 2Test_state hand count =Ê Ê 0, Base_state hand count =Ê Ê 0Test_state deck count =Ê Ê 10, Base_state deck count =Ê Ê 10Test_state discard count = 0, Base_state discard count = 0Test#1 failedTEST#2: Discard Smithy cardERROR: Smithy is not discarded.Test#2 failedTEST#3: unchanged supply cardsTest 3 passed.All tests complete!!          According to random test, the detail result is as follows	test1: test if hand count increase properly0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test2: test if the card count in both deck and discard piles change properly0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test3: test if it discards Smithy card0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test4: test if it keeps supply cards unchanged1000 out of 1000 tests passed!0 out of 1000 tests failed!     Cause: The smithy card implementation function does not include discard function after implementing the card.     	Bug2: For village implementation, hand count increases improperly, and action number increase improperly.	Results:	According to unit test, the result is as follows:TEST#1: Test that the supply is unchangedTest 1 passed.TEST#2: test if deck count decrease properlyTest 2 passed.TEST#3: test if Hand count increase by 1ERROR: Expected Value: 5Ê Actual Value: 6Test 3 failed.TEST#4: test if action increase by 2.ERROR: Expected Value: 3Ê Actual Value: 4.Test 4 failed.TEST#5: test if the number of buys unchanged.Test 5 passed.	According to random test, the result is as follows:test1: Test if the supply is unchanged1000 out of 1000 tests passed!0 out of 1000 tests failed!test2: Test if card count in deck and discard pile change properly0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test3: Test if Hand count increase properly.0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test4: Test if action increase properly.0 out of 1000 tests passed!1000 out of 1000 tests failed!test5: Test if the number of buys unchanged.1000 out of 1000 tests passed!0 out of 1000 tests failed!	Cause:		The village implementation does not include the discard card function. The actions increase 3 instead of 2, which causes the test to fail.
